# Android AI Sample Catalog

![Android AI Sample Catalog screenshots](https://developer.android.com/static/ai/assets/images/ai_sample_catalog_1440.png)

This folder contains the Android AI Sample catalog, a stand alone application giving you access to 
individual self-contained samples illustrating some of the Generative AI capabilities unlocked by 
some of Google's models.

> **Note:** These samples are intended to showcase specific AI capabilities in isolation, and they may use
> simplified code. They are demo not intended to be used as production-ready code.
> For best practices follow our documentation and check

> **Requires Firebase setup** the samples relying on Google Cloud models (Gemini Pro, Gemini Flash, etc...) 
> require setting up a Firebase project and connecting the app to Firebase (read more [here](https://firebase.google.com/docs/ai-logic/get-started?platform=android&api=dev#set-up-firebase)).   

> ðŸš§ **Work-in-Progress:** we are working on bringing more samples into the application.
